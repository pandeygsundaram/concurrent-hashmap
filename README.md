# Concurrent HashMap in Rust

A learning project implementing a thread-safe concurrent hashmap in Rust.

## About

This project follows along with a lecture series to understand and implement concurrent data structures in Rust. The goal is to build a hashmap that can be safely accessed and modified by multiple threads simultaneously.

## Status

Work in progress - following lecture materials and implementing concepts as I learn.

## Topics Covered

- Concurrent data structures
- Thread safety in Rust
- Lock-free programming
- Synchronization primitives
